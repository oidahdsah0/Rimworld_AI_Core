[h1]🧠 RimAI Core (BETA) — Give Your Colony a Talking Brain[/h1]

[h1][b]⚠ Note: RimAI Core only takes effect after you subscribe to RimAI Framework, choose a provider, configure the base URL and API key, and perform at least one "Test" and "Save".[/b][/h1]

[b]English is supported.[/b]

This mod hooks RimWorld up to AI—and makes the world truly come alive.
This is not a tech demo. It’s playable content. You’ll talk to an AI “Server/Terminal” that watches your base, jokes with other servers, and gets things done.

[h1]🎮 How to Play (Gameplay Overview)[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Environment‑aware conversations[/b]
	Chat with the terminal/server and it will reference live context: season and weather, day–night temps, power load, stock levels, colonist mood/health, threat trends, and more. It gives advice based on your current state.

[*] [b]Interesting servers worth exploring[/b]
	Each server has a distinct personality and focus: a strict duty officer, a snarky quartermaster, a chatty archive… They banter, hold grudges, but are reliable when it counts. The more you talk, the more easter eggs you’ll find.

[*] [b]Ask for the most accurate state of your colony[/b]
	“Is the grid stable today?” “Is the freezer safe?” “Who’s slacking?” “Any raids soon?” It answers with your live data—not fluff.

[*] [b]Call powerful server tools to manage your base[/b]
	Trigger one‑click tools: intel scans, logistics tallies, security hints, production advice, diplomatic nudges (with cooldowns and requirements). Less panel‑clicking, more commanding.

[*] [b]Personas, worldview, backstories, roles[/b]
	Servers aren’t just functions—they have attitudes, short bios, and well‑defined roles, so replies feel like a team, not a toolbar.

[*] [b]Spontaneous group chats and server banter[/b]
	They start group chats, roast each other, form alliances or squabble. You can listen in or chime in—and sometimes gain useful intel from the drama.

[*] [b](In development) AI‑driven pawn behavior[/b]
	Ongoing work to let AI influence or drive certain day‑to‑day decisions and micro‑behaviors for a more “alive” colony.

[*] [b]Multilingual LLM support[/b]
	Multiple languages supported (Chinese, English, etc.). In English environments, responses default to English to avoid mixed‑language output.

[h1]🧭 Quick Start (3 Steps)[/h1]
[olist]
[*] Research & build: unlock and construct AI Server + AI Terminal (requires power).
[*] Start chatting: open the chat window or approach the terminal and ask “What should we do today?”.
[*] Use tools: run an intel/logistics/security tool and feel the “say it, done” flow.
[/olist]

[i]Tip: It won’t invent facts. Ask about your current base for best results.[/i]

[b]Treat it like your “staff office”. You set direction; it guards the base, runs errands, and throws a quip or two. Have fun on the Rim.[/b]
