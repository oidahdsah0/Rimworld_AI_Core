[h1]‚ú® Key Features of V4[/h1]

[list]
[*] [b]Intelligent AI Personas:[/b] Interact with distinct AI personalities, from a logical Assistant to unique characters for your colonists. Each persona has its own understanding and way of communicating, driven by a powerful, underlying system prompt architecture.

[*] [b]Extensible Tool System:[/b] The AI is no longer just a spectator. With the new Tooling module, the AI can be equipped with a dynamic "toolbox" of abilities, allowing it to interact with the game world, read data, and eventually, execute commands on your behalf.

[*] [b]Robust Orchestration Engine:[/b] Witness a sophisticated, five-step reasoning process. The AI can now receive a query, decide which tools to use, execute them to gather live game data, and then formulate a comprehensive, context-aware response.

[*] [b]Safe & Responsive:[/b] Built with a dedicated scheduler and anti-corruption layer, all AI interactions with the game are thread-safe, ensuring a smooth, crash-free experience without freezing your UI.

[*] [b]Phased Development:[/b] V4 is being built incrementally, with each phase delivering a stable, verifiable set of features. You are getting access to the cutting edge as it's being developed.

[*] Use the [b]Debug Panel[/b] to test and witness the AI's core capabilities firsthand, from live data-fetching to tool execution.
[*] Ask the AI questions about your colony, and it will use its new `Tooling` system to get live information (e.g., "What's our colony's status?").
[*] Experience the speed and responsiveness of the new streaming and asynchronous architecture.
