# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

RimWorld AI Core is built on a revolutionary dual-layer architecture that separates intelligence from execution, enabling sophisticated AI-driven colony management while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Dual-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: LLM Layer (Intelligence)

The LLM Layer is responsible for understanding, analyzing, and generating intelligent responses based on colony data. This layer implements the **Material Depth System** with five levels of analysis:

#### Material Depth Levels

1. **Level 1: Basic Status** (基础状态)
   - Simple status queries
   - Basic colony information
   - Immediate alerts and notifications

2. **Level 2: Detailed Analysis** (详细分析)
   - Comprehensive data analysis
   - Trend identification
   - Multi-factor correlations

3. **Level 3: Deep Insight** (深度洞察)
   - Strategic pattern recognition
   - Long-term trend analysis
   - Predictive insights

4. **Level 4: Predictive Modeling** (预测建模)
   - Future scenario modeling
   - Risk assessment
   - Outcome probability calculations

5. **Level 5: Strategic Planning** (战略规划)
   - Long-term strategic recommendations
   - Complex multi-step planning
   - Adaptive strategy development

#### LLM Layer Components

### Layer 2: Execution Layer (Action)

The Execution Layer handles the translation of AI insights into concrete game actions. This layer implements the **Action System** with four action types:

#### Action Types

1. **Query**: Information retrieval and analysis
   - Read game state
   - Analyze data
   - Generate reports

2. **Suggest**: Recommendations without execution
   - Propose actions
   - Provide alternatives
   - Offer guidance

3. **Execute**: Direct game world actions
   - Modify game state
   - Trigger events
   - Implement decisions

4. **Monitor**: Continuous monitoring and feedback
   - Track changes
   - Observe outcomes
   - Adjust strategies

## Three-Officer System

### Officer Architecture

Each officer specializes in specific aspects of colony management while sharing common infrastructure:

```
Base Officer
├── AI Context Manager
├── Decision Engine
├── Action Executor
└── Communication Interface

Governor (总督)
├── Colony Overview
├── Strategic Planning
├── Resource Allocation
└── Policy Management

Military Officer (军事官)
├── Threat Assessment
├── Defense Planning
├── Combat Strategy
└── Security Management

Logistics Officer (后勤官)
├── Supply Chain Management
├── Production Planning
├── Inventory Control
└── Efficiency Optimization
```

### Officer Interaction Model

Officers can:
- Operate independently within their domains
- Collaborate on cross-functional decisions
- Escalate complex issues to higher-level AI analysis
- Share information through the centralized knowledge base
